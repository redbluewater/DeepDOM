Study Title	Insights into the controls on metabolite distributions along a latitudinal transect of the western Atlantic Ocean
Study Description	<p>Metabolites, or the small organic molecules that are synthesized by cells during metabolism, comprise a complex and dynamic pool of carbon in the ocean. They are an essential form of information, linking genotype to phenotype at the individual, population and community levels of biological organization. Characterizing metabolite distributions inside microbial cells and dissolved in seawater is essential to understanding the controls on their production and fate, as well as their roles in shaping marine microbial food webs. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics method to quantify particulate and dissolved distributions of a suite of biologically relevant metabolites including vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, osmolytes, and intermediates in biosynthetic pathways along a latitudinal transect in the western Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in the euphotic zone, most particulate or intracellular metabolites positively co-vary with the most abundant microbial taxa. In contrast, dissolved metabolites exhibited greater variability with differences in distribution between ocean regions. Although fewer particulate metabolites were detected below the euphotic zone, molecules identified in the deep ocean may be linked to preservation of organic matter or adaptive physiological strategies of deep-sea microbes. Based on the identified metabolite distributions, we propose relationships between certain metabolites and microbial populations, and find that dissolved metabolite distributions are not directly related to their particulate abundances.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p><strong>Field Sites:</strong></p><p>Samples were collected at multiple depths over the course of 2 cruises in 2013. Cruise KN210-04 (Deep DOM) took place in the western tropical Atlantic from 25 March - 9 May (austral fall), transiting from Montevideo, Uruguay to Bridgetown, Barbados. In the north Atlantic, samples were collected on the second leg of cruise AE1319 transiting from Boothbay Harbor, Maine U.S.A. to Bermuda via the Labrador Sea from 20 August - 11 September (boreal late summer - early fall). On KN210-04&nbsp;samples were collected at depths including 5 m (referred to as the surface), the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) determined by fluorescence, 250 m, Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW, ~1000 m), North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW, ~2500 m), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW, ~5000 m). On cruise AE1319 we collected samples at 5 m, the DCM, Eighteen Degree Mode Water (~350 m, where present), ~1000 m, and 3000 m. See <strong>Table S1</strong>, of the paper associated with this study, for mixed layer, euphotic zone, and DCM depths.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shipboard sample processing:</strong></p><p>Water was collected directly from Niskin bottles into polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or polycarbonate bottles. Water was subsequently filtered through a 0.7-µm (nominal pore size) GF/F filter (Whatman) and a 0.2-µm filter (Omnipore, EMD Millipore) using a peristaltic pump. The filtrate was then acidified with 12 M HCl (~pH 2-3)<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Filters were stored at −80 °C until they could be extracted in the laboratory.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dittmar T, Koch B, Hertkorn N et al.

Dissolved organic molecules were extracted from the filtrate using <strong>solid phase extraction (SPE)</strong> modified styrene-divinylbenzene polymer (<strong>Agilent Bond Elut PPL</strong>). The PPL cartridges were first rinsed with 6 ml of methanol and then the filtrate was pulled through the cartridge via PTFE tubing using a vacuum pump<strong>[1]</strong>. The cartridge was rinsed with ~24 ml of 0.01 M HCl and then allowed to dry by pulling air over the cartridge for 5 min. The sample was then eluted with 6 ml of methanol into a glass test tube and transferred with a Pasteur pipette to an 8 ml amber vial. Both the Omnipore filters and the GFF filters were extracted within 48 h prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Metabolites were extracted with -20 ˚C extraction solvent (40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water + 0.1 M formic acid) and neutralized with 6 M ammonium hydroxide<strong>[2][3]</strong>. All samples were reconstituted with 95:5 water:acetonitrile.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dittmar T, Koch B, Hertkorn N et al.

Eluent A (Milli-Q water with 0.1% formic acid) and Eluent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) were run at 250 µl/min in the following gradient: hold at 5% B for 2 min; ramp to 65% B for 16 min; ramp to 100% B for 7 min and hold for 8 min.

Calibration peaks below a <strong>MAVEN</strong> quality threshold of 0.4 (on a scale of <strong>0-1</strong>) and sample peaks below 0.2 were discarded. To enhance confidence in metabolite identification, quantification and confirmation peaks were required to have retention times within 12 s (0.2 min) of each other. Confirmation ions were required to have a <strong>MAVEN</strong> quality score of at least 0.1 and a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1. Calibration curves were required to have at least 5 calibration points, with the highest point at one concentration level above the highest concentration in a sample. There were 9 available calibration points: 0.5 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 250 ng/ml, 500 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml. Particulate metabolite abundances were adjusted based on ion suppression determined by comparison of a standard spiked pooled sample (1000 ng/ml metabolite standard mix in the sample matrix) to a standard spiked Milli-Q water sample (1000 ng/ml metabolite standard mix without complex matrix<strong>[4]</strong>). Metabolite abundances were normalized to the volume of seawater filtered. The concentrations of dissolved metabolites with extraction efficiencies greater than 1% on a PPL cartridge were corrected to reflect a more accurate estimate of the in situ metabolite concentrations (see extraction efficiencies in <strong>[4]</strong>). Concentrations are given in pM.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R et al.
